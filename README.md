# Building instructions for development

 1. `git clone git@github.com:WeDevelop-ARG/cannabis-app.git`
 2. `npm install`   **(This may take a while)**
 3.  Paste the contents of the special configs folder. This folder is specially made to have the necessary files in the correct paths, so that you can copy-paste or merge it without having to manually search where each file has to go.
 4. **Due to a bug/feature upon downloading special configs folder, you have to rename _env to .env**
 5. `npm start` to open metro server.
 6. `react-native run-android` to run app on a virtual o physical device.
